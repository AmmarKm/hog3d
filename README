### Compiling ###

In order to compile the hog3d feature extraction tool you need to have the following libraries installed on your system:
* OpenCV library (tested with version 2)
* ffmpeg library
* boost libraries

If these libraries are installed, simply type 'make' to compile the tool. The executable will be in the directory './release/'.


### run a test ###

To check whether the tool is working properly, run the following command:

./release/extractFeatures -p test_sequences/walk-simple.pos test_sequences/walk-simple.avi > out.features

Congratulations, you have computed your first HOG3D features :) ! You want to compare your file out.features with the file that I have computed myself to verify that everything is working correctly. To do so, type:

vimdiff out.features test_sequences/hollywood2.features

Note that I experienced differences in the exact feature information for different versions of ffmpeg library. Try to use a recent snapshot.


### Bugs and extensions ###

Various questions have already been posed .. I put up a FAQ on my website. If you experience problems or have questions, please check whether the FAQ will give you an answer:

If you find bugs, etc., feel free to drop me a line. Also if you developed some extension to the program, let me know and I can include it in the tool. You can find my contact data on my webpage, as well.
